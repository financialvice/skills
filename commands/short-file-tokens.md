description: Minimize token usage in a file while retaining all key information
argument-hint: FILE=<file-path>
---

Read the file at $FILE, then Edit it to minimize tokens. Trim aggressively for token savings; retain every key fact, figure, and conclusion, remove redundancy/filler. Avoid "**" asterisk formatting. Reason: Every token consumes space in agents token window and we want to minimize it.

Rewrite the file in place using the Edit tool.
