description: Setup an autonomous software development cycle, inspired by Anthropic's "Effective harnesses for long-running agents" blog (https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents). Adapted to fit our tech-stack (TypeScript, NextJS, InstantDB, Trigger.dev, tRPC) and style (kebab-case file-naming).
